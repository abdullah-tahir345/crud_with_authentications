# crud_with_authentications

1 - CRUD Operations:
    
    Create: The ability to add new data or records to a database.
    Read: The capability to retrieve and view existing data from a database.
    Update: The option to modify and update data in the database.
    Delete: The functionality to remove data or records from the database.
2 - User Authentication:

    Login: This feature allows users to log into the application with their credentials (username/email and password).
    Registration: New users can create accounts by providing necessary information such as a username, email, and password. After registration, they can log in with their newly created credentials.
In this project first I have create the Login system using Django and then merge the CRUD project in it. I have used different authentications system and also login decoratore. You can download the project file and the open cmd in that folder.

After that you'll have to run these commanads line by line.

    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py runserver
And after that go to the link http://127.0.0.1 and you'll be able to run this project on your PC.
